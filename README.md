Public Curious Bot repo for open source

This repo is an open source version of the curiousbot for discord api, with the client token and venv removed.

This project is written in Python including discord.py, selenium, requests, and google drive, sheets, and cloud apis. It was not initially written for public viewership, and has a lack of rigorous commenting. If you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach out to me on discord @Curious Beats#2276 or email gdeljevic@gmail.com
