Public Curious Bot repo for open source

This repo is an open source version of the curiousbot for discord api, with the client secret and venv removed.

This branch is for FF related functionalities only. 

This bot will, given an AO3, FF.net, or wattpad profiles, count the sum of follows on FF.net, kudos on AO3, and votes / total chapters * total stories on wattpad. Mostly this repository is provided if anyone might find the webscraping methods useful to perform similar operations. If you'd like the bot implemented on your server or to have an adjusted functionality, DM me @Curious Beats#2276

To run the function, type `follows [URL] in an allowed channel. To get help, simply type `followshelp.
